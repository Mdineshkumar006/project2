            Christian von Koenigsegg got the idea to build his own car after watching the Norwegian stop-motion animated movie The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix in his youth.[13] At 22 years old, Koenigsegg gathered kr 60,000,000 from investors and founded Koenigsegg Automotive in 1994.[14]

Initially, Koenigsegg Automotive was based in Olofström. In the early 2000s, the company moved to Ängelholm.[15] On 22 February 2003, one of the production facilities caught fire and was badly damaged.[16] Koenigsegg then acquired an abandoned air field to use as his new factory building and in late 2003, one of the two large fighter-jet hangars and an office building were converted into a car factory. Since then, the company is located near the still-active Ängelholm airport. Koenigsegg controls and uses the former military runway for shakedown runs of production cars and high-speed testing.[17]

In July 2023 Koenigsegg opened a newly built factory, close to the old factory building in Ängeholm, doubling the production capacity.[18]

Prototypes and production

The Koenigsegg CC prototype which became the basis for future models of the company
The initial design of the CC was penned down by Christian von Koenigsegg. Industrial designer David Crafoord realised the sketches as a 1:5 
stomer 
and high-speed testing.[17]
